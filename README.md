# Screening for early-stage Alzheimerâ€™s disease using optimized feature sets and machine learning

\** All data used in the preparation of this code were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. A list of the features used can be found in the file **List_of_Features.md**

Code is located in the **code** directory, arranged in the order they are used to generate outputs. The exception is the splitrepeat.py file, which is a custom-created high stochasticity cross-validation procedure, outlined in an upcoming publication.

Generated feature sets and pairs of feature sets can be found in **Selected_Sets.md**

Model outputs are found in the **models** directory, and contain sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and F1 scores for each of the model iterations. The statistical analyses of these outputs are found in the code directory in the "5-Stats" notebooks.

Note that in file names, "Imp" or "Impaired" implies the two-class "Impaired vs non-impaired" classification method, while multiclass implies the three-class "CDR 0 vs CDR 0.5 vs CDR 1"
