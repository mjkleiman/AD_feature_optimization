Code is located in the "code" directory, arranged in the order they are used to generate outputs. The exception is the splitrepeat.py file, which is a custom-created high stochasticity cross-validation procedure, outlined in an upcoming publication.

Model outputs are found in the "models" directory, and contain sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and F1 scores for each of the model iterations.

Note that in file names, "Imp" or "Impaired" implies the two-class "Impaired vs non-impaired" classification method, while multiclass implies the three-class "CDR 0 vs CDR 0.5 vs CDR 1"
